// AirhopBLEModule: dual-role BLE GATT server + central for Airhop mesh.
//
// Mirrors the iOS AirhopBLEModule.swift contract exactly. Four operations:
//   1. Advertise as a GATT Server with the Airhop service UUID.
//   2. Scan as a GATT Central for peers advertising the same UUID.
//   3. Accept incoming writes and emit them to TypeScript as events.
//   4. Write raw bytes from TypeScript to connected GATT peripherals.
//
// Protocol logic lives in TypeScript (src/core/). This file has no knowledge
// of packet types, routing, or encryption.

    // neither a check nor a catch, so a Bluetooth toggle in any of those windows
